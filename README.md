# Semiotax
Semiotax is a term coined from the Greek semeiotikos (‘meaningful’) and taxis (‘order’, ‘organization’), so its etymological sense corresponds to 'meaningful order' or 'organization that produces meaning'.
Semiotax is a linguistic theory which is also called Sentence Semiotax (SS) because it is applied basically to the study of the sentence sequence (when dealing with a higher level unit, we should speak of Text Semiotax). It seeks to carry out an analysis of the information conveyed by natural languages from three different -although closely related- fields: the cognitive, the formal, and the functional one. Therefore, its aim is to highlight the way in which the organization (taxis) of the cognitive, formal, and functional structure of a sentence expresses its meaning through a series of diverse semiotic flows (semeiotikos). It adopts an eclectic perspective with respect to the functionalist (or communicative) and the formalist (or syntactocentric) grammatical models.
